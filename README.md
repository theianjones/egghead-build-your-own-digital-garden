# Build Your Own Digital Garden

So you have a bunch of notes and you want to share them with the world (or with your future self), how do you do it? This course will take you from having a stack of notes to a fully customized digital garden.

In this course, we will be take a folder full of markdown files and create a website out of them. These files will have links to reference one another. We will build out a processor that handles these links so that we can display the backlinks for each file.

This course will give you the super power of being able to process any type of content.

## Whats a digital garden?

A digital garden is kind of like a blog. With blogs, you have a chronological list of posts that you can share with the world.

Generally, these posts are listed chronologically. This is generally fine but the date you publish a post usually a poor way to present your work to the world.

A garden is hand crafted. You pick the specific posts you want on your homepage.

Also, digital garden insinuates your ideas need to be cultivated over time. You should create notes on a subject and densely link them to related ideas or concepts. This was part of the idea around the internet with hyperlinked webpages pointing to each other.

With all this said...

A digital garden if a very personal endeavor.

You take notes exactly how you want to, so the features that you expect out of your garden will depend on how you think.

You'll like find features you need when you use some pre-baked solution that someone has made for you. So having full control of how you take notes, and then how you display them on your website gives you the ability to implement functionality you want to see in your own garden.

## Why take this course?
