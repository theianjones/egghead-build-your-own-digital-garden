# Build Your Own Digital Garden

How should we order these sections so that someone can read through the whole document without jumping back and forth between sections? #Meta

So you have a bunch of notes and you want to share them with the world (or with your future self), how do you do it? This course will take you from having a stack of notes to a beautiful fully customized digital garden.

Why do you want to own your own digital garden? #ebomb

A digital garden if a very personal endeavor. You take notes exactly how you want to, so the features that you expect out of your garden will depend on how you think. You'll like find features you need when you use some pre-baked solution that someone has made for you. So having full control of how you take notes, and then how you display them on your website gives you the ability to implement functionality you want to see in your own garden.

We will be using Unified.js to process your files and turn them into something that React.js understands.
